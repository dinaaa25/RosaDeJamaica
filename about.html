                    <h2>Our Story: The Red Gold of Guatemala</h2>

                    <p>
                        We are a couple—one from Europe, one from Guatemala—connected by a discovery we couldn't keep to
                        ourselves.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In Guatemala, <strong>Rosa de Jamaica</strong> is legendary. It’s the drink you find on every
                        corner, the local "cool-down" that’s as common as soda but entirely natural. When we first
                        shared it together, it was a revelation: how could something this beautiful, this healthy, and
                        this bold still be a secret in Europe?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>We decided it was time to change that.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        More than just a flower. It’s the ultimate
                        lifestyle hack for anyone who loves flavor without the fluff. It’s your morning ritual as a
                        warm, soul-soothing tea; your summer afternoon as a sharp, iced lemonade; and your weekend vibe
                        in a craft cocktail.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        From artisanal syrups to small-batch ice cream, its tart, cranberry-like edge is unlike anything
                        else. We’re bringing this Guatemalan staple to the European stage. It’s vibrant, it’s
                        refreshing, and it’s about to become your <strong>new favorite obsession</strong>.
